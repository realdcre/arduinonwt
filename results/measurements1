# measurements

    There were significant problems regarding the LDR Sensor on the arduinonwt project hardware. The sensor gave a constant 5V on 5V High and 0V on OV/GND Low power. Therefor the variations are non-existent and values cannot be taken from measurements.
    The reason for failiure are multiple defects with diffrent LDRs.

    Value Span

    - on 5V High
        High: 5.00
        Low: 4.96
        Avg: 5.00
    - on 0V/GND Low
        High: 0.15
        Low: 0.00
        Avg: 0.00

    These false measurements are given in Volt.

# result

    There was no result due to no measurements taken
